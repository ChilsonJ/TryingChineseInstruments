# Trying Chinese Instruments

We made small attempts to mimic some Chinese Instruments with Pure Data.

## Getting Started

1. Download [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/)

2. Open the drum_erhu_dizi.pd
3. Click the outermost toggle on the top

## Future Work

- Making this program sound more like real intruments
- Trying to make music in Chinese style and chord
