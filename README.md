# Trying Chinese Instruments

We made small attempts to mimic some Chinese Instruments with Pure Data.

## Getting Started

1. Download [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/)

2. Open the drum_erhu_dizi.pd

3. Click the outermost toggle on the top

## p5js version

&emsp;We also have a web version of this project [[link]](https://editor.p5js.org/FooJiaYin/full/VaW3goaz2) though the sound is different on the web.

## Future Work

- Making this program sound more like real intruments
- Trying to make music in Chinese style and chord
